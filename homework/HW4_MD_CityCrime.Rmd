title: "HW4 MD CityCrime"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset of total crimes reported by Maryland cities for two consecutive years. You'll load the data, calculate the violent and property crime rates for each city for both years, and then calculate the percentage change in the crime rates between the two years. You'll also write a short story based on your findings.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse and Janitor

You will need to load the tidyverse library and the janitor library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv. You will create a dataframe called `md_cities` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data

```{r}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_cities_crime_2019_2020.csv") |> 
clean_names()
```
### Task 3: Calculating Rates

Calculate violent and property crime rates for each city for both years using `mutate()`. You'll create four new columns: `violent_rate_2019`, `property_rate_2019`, `violent_rate_2020`, and `property_rate_2020`. You'll need to figure out the proper unit rate, given that there are varying populations. There's no perfect choice; choose the one that works best for you. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_rates`.

```{r}
md_cities_rates <- md_cities |> mutate(violent_rate_2019 = violent2019/pop2019 *1000, property_rate_2019 = property2019/pop2019 * 1000, violent_rate_2020 = violent2020/pop2020 *1000, property_rate_2020 = property2020/pop2020 *1000)
```

### Task 4: Describe the Rates

Examine the new dataframe, `md_cities_rates`, by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio and sorting by the rate columns. Write a couple of sentences about the results, comparing and contrasting the cities with the highest rates (both violent and property) in 2019 and 2020. Do you see any patterns? What does this tell you about crime in Maryland cities? What's the story here?

ANSWER HERE
Baltimore had the worst violent crime rate in 2019, and Ocean City had the highest property crime rate in 2019. Then, Ocean City had the worst violent crime rate and the highest property crime rate in 2020. Clearly Ocean City has a pattern of high crime rates. These findings show that the cities with the worst crime rates are consistent and didn't change drastically between 2019 and 2020. The story here could be where to and where not to live based on crime rates in Maryland cities. 

### Task 5: Calculate Percentage Change

Let's add two percentage change columns to your dataframe: one for violent crime rates and one for property crime rates. You'll calculate the percentage change between 2019 and 2020 for each city. Save the results to a new dataframe called `md_cities_change`.

```{r}
md_cities_change <- md_cities_rates |> mutate(violent_percent_change = (violent_rate_2020-violent_rate_2019)/violent_rate_2019 * 100, property_percent_change = (property_rate_2020-property_rate_2019)/property_rate_2019 * 100)
```

### Task 7: Describe Percentage Changes

Look at the `md_cities_change` dataframe by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the percentage change results. What's more interesting here, the patterns or the outliers? What's the story in the data?

ANSWER HERE
Like the previous question, Ocean City does remain very prominent in terms of their increased rates of violent and property crimes, with violent crime increasing by 82% and property crimes increasing by 16%. Baltimore, however, did see a decrease in both property crimes and violent crimes. The outliers also stood out to me, with nine cities having increases of over 100%. For example, Edmonston saw a violent crime increase of 895%.


### Task 8: Tell the Best Story

Write up a lede and nutgraf of a story with the _best_ story idea you've found in this assignment. The lede should be a single sentence that summarizes the most important information in the data. The nutgraf should be a paragraph that provides more context and explains why the data is important.

ANSWER HERE
Crime data shows nine Maryland Cities have increased rates of over one hundred percent.

Whether it be property crime rates or violent crime rates, nine cities across Maryland have seen increases in their crime rates of over 100 percent. Cottage City, MD saw their violent crime rates increase by 149% between 2019 and 2020. Crisfield, MD also saw a 320% increase in property crimes between 2019 and 2020. While many cities are seeing decreases in crime rates, these nine cities have not yet perfected their strategies for decreasing crime.



### Task 9: Save Your Work and Put it on GitHub

Save this notebook, then commit it to your local repository. Push the changes to your GitHub repository and submit the URL for this file in ELMS.
